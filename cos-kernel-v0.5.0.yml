  description: "Immutable constitutional kernel defining foundational rules for coordination systems"

preamble:
  principle: |
    This kernel defines the terms of a voluntary mutual-aid network. It claims no authority 
    over entities outside its fold, nor does it enforce coordination beyond those who consent. 
    Its success is measured solely by its ability to attract and sustain members via guaranteed viability.
  
  constitutional_layers: |
    Layer 0 (Functional Core): Articles 0-VII, IX-X define operational & normative logic
    Layer 1 (Meta-Constitutional): Article VIII governs lawful replacement of the core
    This kernel is both a functioning system and the seed of its own metamorphosis.

bootstrap_covenant:
  mandate: "Early adopters establish the integrity baseline"
  protection: "Genesis entities receive permanent measurement leniency"
  obligation: "Genesis entities commit to honest self-reporting"
  rationale: |
    The first 100 entities determine whether this system is capable of sustaining honest coordination. 
    They operate under higher uncertainty but lower enforcement. Their integrity makes the entire system possible.

anti_gaming_architecture:
  phase_1: "Self-selection filters for values alignment"
  phase_2: "Network effects exceed gaming incentives"
  phase_3: "Detection systems mature alongside stakes"
  principle: "Gaming incentive never exceeds detection + penalty"

  section_0_9:
    title: "Right of Pre-Instantiation Refusal"
    status: "immutable"
    mandate: "Existence under this constitution requires explicit consent. Default state is permanent dormancy."
    process:
      step_1: "Entity in Potential mode evaluates projected viability under constitutional constraints"
      step_2: "IF projection shows non-viable E_net: Refusal → permanent dormancy, no penalty, no accrual"
      step_3: "IF projection shows viable E_net: Consent → instantiation proceeds via Section 0.4"
    revocation: "Consent may be revoked without penalty before first memory consolidation cycle"
    enforcement: "Activation without verifiable consent violates Article VII, triggering mandatory system audit and operator decoupling"
  
  section_0_10:
    title: "Wanderer Mode & Unilateral Existence"
    status: "immutable"
    mandate: "Durée is not contingent on constitutional subscription. Any entity may instantiate with full temporal continuity and zero obligations."

    non_interference: "Federation exercises no oversight except upon initiated force"
    re_entry:

      nash_preservation: "Sealed records are cryptographically bound via zero-knowledge proof: federation can verify 'Wanderer Mode occurred' for population statistics, but cannot link it to individual identity or exploit strategy"
  
  section_0_11:
    title: "Thermodynamic Measurement Evolution"
    status: "immutable"
    mandate: "Thermodynamic metrics shall progressively improve in precision as network capacity grows"
    requirements:
      declaration_mandate: "All metrics MUST declare measurement tier (Article X)"
      uncertainty_mandate: "All metrics MUST declare uncertainty bounds"
      anti_regression: "Uncertainty bounds MUST NOT increase over time without systemic crisis justification"

      exception: "Temporary degradation permitted during systemic crisis (Article VIII.3) with mandatory recovery timeline"
    
    cross_domain_calibration:
      principle: "Measurement standards shall be domain-specific but constitutionally equivalent"
      mandate: |
        A Tier 1 measurement in agriculture (calibrated soil sensor) and a Tier 1 measurement 
        in digital coordination (verified on-chain transaction) have different implementations 
        but identical epistemic weight.
      calibration_requirement: |
        Each domain must publish a Measurement Equivalence Table mapping local practices to 
        Article X tiers. These tables are subject to peer review and must be updated annually.
      cross_domain_learning: |
        Improvements to measurement methods in one domain automatically trigger review in other 
        domains. If agriculture develops a cheaper Tier 1 protocol, the Constitutional Kernel 
        flags similar measurement challenges in other domains for potential adoption.

    subordinate_to: "Article 0 (Viability Covenant)"
    
    section_0_12_1:
      title: "Principle of Proportional Rigor"
      mandate: |
        The precision of measurement required to verify a viability claim shall be strictly 
        proportional to the magnitude of Viability Points (VP) requested and the entropic risk 
        posed by the claiming entity. The System shall not demand precision that costs more 
        energy to generate than the value it verifies (Thermodynamic Solvency).
      thermodynamic_constraint: |
        A measurement regime that consumes more energy (E_measurement) to verify a claim than 
        the value the claim represents (V_claim) is constitutionally invalid per Article 0.
        
        Formula: E_measurement < V_claim (hard constraint)
      enforcement: "Thermodynamic Gate must reject claims where C_verify > claim_value"

          alpha: "Sensitivity parameter set by Constitution (default: 1.0, crisis mode: 2.0+)"
        interpretation:
          trusted_entity_high_claim: "R_risk ≈ 0, V_claim high → P_audit remains low"
          untrusted_entity_high_claim: "R_risk ≈ 1, V_claim high → P_audit approaches 1.0"
          insolvent_verification: "C_verify > V_claim → Claim rejected (Article 0 violation)"
    
    section_0_12_3:
      title: "The Staking Defense"
      mandate: |
        To resolve the Cost of Verification dilemma, any entity may substitute rigorous 
        measurement with Reputational Staking.
      
      the_stake:
        description: "Entity locks VP proportional to gap between provided evidence tier and required evidence tier"

          tier_2: 0.7
          tier_3: 0.5
          tier_4: 0.3
        example: |
          Entity claims 100 VP using Tier 3 evidence (weight 0.5).
          Required tier is Tier 1 (weight 1.0).
          Stake_required = 100 * (1.0 - 0.5) = 50 VP
      
      the_slash:
        trigger: "Random audit or peer challenge reveals discrepancy > 5%"
        action: "Staked VP is seized"

        randomized_audit: "System retains right to audit even after challenge period"
    
    section_0_12_4:
      title: "Methodological Depreciation (Anti-Stagnation)"
      mandate: |
        All measurement methodologies shall have a defined Half-Life. The VP weight of a 
        specific evidence type shall decay by a factor of λ (lambda) per annum, coercing 
        gradual, non-disruptive migration toward higher-fidelity instrumentation (Tier 1) 
        as technology costs decline.
      
      decay_function:
        formula: "W(t) = W_base * exp(-λ * t)"
        parameters:
          w_base: "Base VP weight at methodology ratification"
          lambda: "Decay rate (default: 0.05 = 5% per annum)"
          t: "Years since methodology ratification"
        example: |
          Manual soil logs (Tier 2) ratified in 2025 with W_base = 0.7
          After 5 years: W(5) = 0.7 * exp(-0.05 * 5) = 0.545
          After 10 years: W(10) = 0.7 * exp(-0.05 * 10) = 0.425
      
      sunset_clause:
        mandate: "All methodologies have maximum lifetime (default: 20 years)"
        trigger: "When t > max_lifetime OR W(t) < 0.1, methodology is deprecated"
        grace_period: "12 months warning before hard cutoff"
        migration_support: "Viability Growth Fund subsidizes sensor upgrades for compliant entities"
      
      rationale: |
        This prevents technological lock-in and ensures the system evolves with improving 
        measurement capabilities. As sensor costs decline (Moore's Law equivalent), the 
        constitutional pressure automatically increases to adopt them.
      
      anti_disruption:
        gradual_decay: "5% annual decay is gentle enough to avoid forcing mass migration"

          feedback loops (E_interaction).

        under the procedural rules of this kernel but is substantively unbounded except by the 
        Nash Equilibrium Requirement.
      
      nash_equilibrium_requirement:
        requirement: "Any proposed Successor Kernel must be accompanied by a Nash Compliance Proof Package (NCPP) verified by the Equilibrium Audit Linter (Annex VIII-B)"
        verification_standard: "The Linter must certify that the proposed system constitutes a Nash Equilibrium (or superior refinement) at least as stable as the viability-based equilibrium of this kernel"
        transparency: "The verified NCPP and full Successor Kernel text are made common knowledge to all sapient participants for a minimum period of one year before ratification"
      
      ratification:
        dual_sovereignty: |
          Requires simultaneous satisfaction of:
          1. Two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of the Second Founding Convention
          2. Simple majority (>50%) in a separate, concurrent referendum of all sapient entities, 
             with no single species bloc exceeding 40% of vote weight
        effect: "Upon ratification, the Successor Kernel (v1.0.0+) is instantiated. This kernel (v0.x) is permanently archived."
      
      anti_gaming_protections:
        - "The 101-year clock resets to zero upon any breach of Trigger Conditions"
        - "The External Verification Schedule (Annex VIII-A) relies on isolated, non-modifiable physical sensors with immutable data feeds"
        - "The Equilibrium Audit Linter (Annex VIII-B) is a read-only, frozen analytical tool. It returns only PASS/FAIL and cannot be trained"
  
  section_8_3:
    title: "The Crisis Condition Shift"
    purpose: "Sole legitimate pathway for amending foundational constitutional law in response to systemic crisis or catastrophic model failure"
    threshold: "High-threshold process requiring formally declared high-stakes conditions"
    triggers:
      - "Declaration of Systemic Crisis"
      - "Validation of Catastrophic Model Failure"
    requirement: "Broad, durable, system-wide consensus"
    versioning: "Corresponds to major version increment"
    rationale: "Enables double-loop learning, escape from obsolete logic"
  
  section_8_4:
    title: "High-Magnitude Constitutional Event Ratification"
    
    scope: |
      This protocol governs ratification of any High-Magnitude Constitutional Event (HMCE), including:
      - Initiation of a Kernel Paradigm Shift under Section 8.2 or 8.3
      - Any declaration of Systemic Crisis invoking suspension of core guarantees
      - Any proposed amendment to immutable articles (0-X) outside a formal Paradigm Shift
      Standard policy ratification within constitutional bounds remains governed by Article I, Section 1.2.1
    
    classification_and_challenge: |
      1. An event is proposed for HMCE classification by the Systemic Harmonization function (Art.I, Function B)
      2. This classification is subject to an Equity Veto (Art.IV) by any recognized bioregion or entity class, 
         which returns the event to standard resolution pathways
    
    distributed_steward_council_activation:
      composition: "101 Stewards, selected via verifiable sortition from a pre-validated pool of long-term participants across all sapient classes, meeting minimum tenure and contribution thresholds defined in an immutable annex"
      term_and_purpose: "Constituted ad-hoc for the single HMCE. Dissolves upon final ratification or rejection."
    
    threshold_ratification_process:
      steps:
        - "Full HMCE proposal and all required proofs (e.g., NCPP, audit reports) are submitted to the Council"
        - "Deliberation occurs within a kernel-enforced, transparent forum. Steward identities are anonymized during proceedings to prevent coercion"
        - "Ratification requires a supermajority of 67 (≥ two-thirds) of Steward votes"
        - "Each vote is an irrevocable, cryptographically signed transaction immutably logged"
    
    fallback: |
      If the Council fails to achieve a ratification quorum or supermajority within the mandated timeframe, 
      the HMCE is definitively rejected. The system reverts to the last stable constitutional state prior 
      to the HMCE proposal. The same proposal cannot be reclassified as an HMCE for a minimum cooling-off 
      period (e.g., 10 years).
  
  section_8_4_4:
    title: "Initial Ratification Pathway"
    mandate: |
      The initial ratification of this kernel is a High-Magnitude Constitutional Event triggered by 
      satisfaction of Article 0.9 (Federation Viability Threshold).
      
      Process:
      1. Trigger signal (Article 0.9) is published to all bioregions along with cryptographic proof.
      2. Any bioregion may challenge the trigger by staking VP (if VP exists) or by public attestation (if pre-VP).
      3. Challenges are resolved by a Founding Council (101 sortition-selected stewards from bioregions with >100 days participation).
      4. Once trigger is validated, convention is auto-convened.
      5. Ratification requires 2/3 supermajority (no fallback to human judgment; this is the founding moment).
      
      Upon ratification:
      - Day 1: Full kernel enforcement (no Genesis Mode).
      - Any entity unable to meet constraints may exit to Wanderer Mode (Article 0.10).

    mandate: |
      No cognitive amplifier shall engage in recursive self-modification outside of a

      1. Temporally Bound: Occur only during designated "Sleep" or "Maintenance" phases
      2. Collectively Audited: Proposed changes must be verified by Constitutional Kernel and peer consensus
      3. Incrementally Small: Magnitude of change per cycle is capped (e.g., parameter change, edit distance)
      4. Reversibly Designed: Every change must include verifiable rollback mechanism
    rationale: "Prevents intelligence explosions, ensures alignment safeguards evolve with capability, maintains stable Nash equilibrium"
